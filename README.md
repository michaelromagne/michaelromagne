# 👋

As a ML Engineer, I have contributed end-to-end to the productionization of multiple AI products at Ubisoft, GitGuardian, and Sanofi.

**Sanofi (Dec 2024 - Present) | MLOps Engineer - GenAI & LLMOps**
- Development of an Unstructured Data Pipeline processing millions of PDFs for Sanofi teams, using Terraform, Python and Docker. OCR with Docling  and VLMs (AWS Bedrock models), metadata extraction with LLMs,chunking, vectorisation and Retrieval with Pinecone
- Developed an internal benchmarking framework with DVC & Weave to compare open-source OCR libraries and VLMs (Qwen VL, Bedrock models).
- Advocate for W&B Weave internally for GenAI Benchmarks and monitoring : tutorials demos at Sanofi lunches, video content...
- Stack: AWS Lambda, S3, ECR, Step Functions, Claude Sonnet, Amazon Nova Pro, Docling, HuggingFace, AWS Textract, PyMuPDF, Pinecone, W&B Weave

**GitGuardian (Oct 2023 - Dec 2024) | Machine Learning Engineer**
- Built the company MLOps stack from scratch: GitLab CI, SkyPilot, DVC, Dagster, BentoML, Helm, ArgoCD
- Fine-tuned and integrated NLP models (CodeBERTa) into the Secrets Detection Engine, reducing false positives by 5x
- Stack: Transformers, PyTorch, FastAPI, ONNX Runtime, AWS EKS, Django, Celery, Kubernetes

**Ubisoft (Feb 2021 - Oct 2023) | Machine Learning Engineer**
- End-to-end fraud detection project for e-commerce transactions (Ubisoft Connect and Steam)
- Led research tasks (feature engineering, semi-supervised learning) and implemented MLOps best practices
- Saved 5% of net sales (~4M€/year) compared to previous fraud detection product
- Stack: XGBoost, DVC, ClearML, AWS Sagemaker, ECS, Kubernetes, Hadoop, Snowflake, Spark


**[The Scouting Arena](https://the-scouting-arena.com)**
- Web platform helping football fans discover and scout new players using advanced analytics
