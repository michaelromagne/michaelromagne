# üëã Hey !

I am Micha√´l Romagn√©, I come from Brittany and I live in Paris, France. I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/) on helping individual developers and companies identify leaked secrets and address security incidents.

Previously, I worked at Ubisoft on putting Machine Learning models in production to detect e-commerce fraudulent transactions at Ubisoft. I also contributed to a time-series forecasting tool used by Business Analyst to predict Acquisition, Activity, Monetization as well as CPU Usage on our internal servers.


## üíª Open source projects

I am getting more involved in open source projects outside of work:

- I participated in a [Data For Good](https://dataforgood.fr/) project in mid 2023 called [e-cartomobile](https://github.com/dataforgoodfr/batch11_e_cartomobile) to help cities and regions identify if there is a lack of infrastructures to charge electric cars in their area and take decisions.
- I made my first contribution to a bigger project called [Bentoctl](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoctl/pull/214)


## ‚öΩ Hobbies

Apart from coding, I love practicing sports (especially Football and Gym), read philosophy or history books and grab some beers with friends.
