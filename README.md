# üëã Hey !

I am Micha√´l Romagn√©, I come from Brittany and I live in Paris, France. I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/) on helping individual developers and companies identify leaked secrets and address security incidents with automated remediation.


Previously, I worked at Ubisoft on putting Machine Learning models in production to detect e-commerce fraudulent transactions at Ubisoft. I also contributed to a time-series forecasting tool used to predict Acquisition, Activity, Monetization in Ubisoft games as well as CPU Usage on Ubisoft internal servers.
